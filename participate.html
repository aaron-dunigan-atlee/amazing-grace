                    in a pit); music (guitar, singing around the campfire); exploring nature; learning about farm animals (rabbits, goats, chickens);

                <h2>History of Amazing Grace Camps</h2>
                <p>The Episcopal Church opened Grace Camp in 1994 in the Diocese of Rio Grande, New Mexico, beginning the effort to show those children unconditional love and a glimpse of a different life. Since then, twenty-seven dioceses across the United States have explored and expanded this ministry or have opened summer camps for children whose parents are imprisoned.

                        The Rev. Stephen R. Caldwell, who founded Grace Camp, has written, in collaboration with the Rev. Jackie Means, a practical guide for starting a prison ministry camp. Means, now retired, was the Episcopal Church’s director of Prison Ministries and is responsible for inspiring many of the camps.
                        
                        “Campers are surprised to discover that our love for them is unconditional,” said Caldwell. “To our utter amazement, attitudes and behaviors do get altered in that brief time.”
                        
                        “We hope to break the cycle of incarceration tearing apart families with a week of healing and emotional support,” said the Rev. Eddie Blue, director of Maryland’s first camp.</p>

                <h2>Testimonial of Ross Anderson</h2>
                <h5>Ross Anderson is a long-time leader in prison ministry, and has helped organize a similar camp for children of the incarcerated in Vermont.  This is his experience:</h5>
                <p>My first experience with the corrections industry was in the middle 80’s some thirty years ago, as a small business owner in Vermont who wanted to help graduate productive citizens back into the community. This led me to prison ministry with Kairos Prison Ministry International as well as Horizon Communities in Prison; as a volunteer, then officer and director of those organizations into the early 2000’s. I was privileged to volunteer in some of the toughest maximum and medium security prisons in this country. Anyone who has spent any time within the prison industrial complex will tell you how difficult it is for these individuals to return into community. 

                        What isn’t often thought about by the public is the toll it takes on their families. The children are often shunned by their potential playmates and I use the word “potential” because as soon as the parents of the other children realize their child’s playmate’s parent is incarcerated they restrict their children from associating with them. From an early age they learn to distrust, shut down emotionally and often turn to anger in order to cope with their ostracism. The results of this are that some 70% of these children will themselves become incarcerated at some point in their lives if they have a parent who is or has been incarcerated; if both parents have, then it rises to 90%. I have personally witnessed three generations of the same family incarcerated in the same prison and the expense to society is incalculable. 
                        
                        That is why programs and camps such as the Amazing Grace Program are so important. Early intervention is a proven change agent and is a first step to reduce generational incarceration. How can you not support this effort by volunteering in some capacity or sponsoring one of these very deserving kids? There all kinds of ways, from helping in registration, just spending time quietly in those moments when these children need “Quiet time”. What about spending a night with them in the platform structures reading and listening or sharing some of your craft and story-telling skills; Call us, join us in informational meetings, or send whatever financial gifts you are able to.  
                        
                        I know from my experience with Camp Agape in Vermont how special this program can be. As one sixteen year old at this year’s reunion said to us, “It has made me a different person” and this year he will act as a Councilor in Training at the camp. So, hop aboard the Amazing Grace train and enjoy the ride!!</p>
