Banner photos should be wide (>=1600px), vertically centered around something of interest.  
Banner height is 200px so only the middle 200px get shown on largest screens.
Aspect ratio should be 2:1 or less (width:length) so that no whitespace appears on mobile devices.

Images for page launchers (in the gallery on main page) should be 200x200px or larger, and square.

For carousel, images should be at least 1600px wide and aspect ration of 5:2 (1600x640 works well)
